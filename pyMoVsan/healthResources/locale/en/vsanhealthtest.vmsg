com.vmware.vsan.health.test.networkperftest.testResult.columnDesiredBandwidth = Maximum Achievable Bandwidth Result (MB/s)
com.vmware.vsan.health.test.networkperftest = Multicast performance test is designed to assess if there is not only connectivity, but if multicast speed among the hosts can satisfy vSAN's requirements. The test does so by picking one host as the sender, and having all other hosts be receivers. By virtue of being multicast traffic, any packet that the senders sends should be delivered to all receivers. Thus, in theory, if there were no bottlenecks in ESXi and this test case, and if the physical network could run at full wire speed, a 10Gbit/s sender would result in 10Gbit/s being received by all receivers. In practice, this test is not able to fully saturate the sender link. In addition, almost no physical switch is able to perform multicast at full wire speed. vSAN in fact doesn't need to run at full wire speed. vSAN needs less than 20MB/s (or 200 Mbit/s) of multicast speed during peak load. On typical enterprise grade switches from any of the common vendors, the test will be able to achieve at least 50 MB/s. On some very low end switches VMware has observed as low as 10MB/s. Given these ranges, the test will conclude that anything below 20MB/s is too low, that anything between 20MB/s and 50MB/s is low but OK, and anything above 50MB/s is within what VMware would expect
com.vmware.vsan.health.test.networkperftest.short = Checks if the network meets the multicast bandwidth requirements of vSAN (at least 50 MBps).

com.vmware.vsan.health.test.unicastperftest = Network performance test is designed to assess the network bandwidth of the hosts. The test is performed between the hosts in a ring structure, i.e. every host sends packets to its next host while receives from the previous. The test will examine the network bandwidth that can be achieved between hosts and will report warning if the bandwidth is less than 850Mbps. Note: the available network bandwidth has critical impact to the overall vSAN performance. For details about the network bandwidth required by a certain vSAN configuration, please click 'Ask VMware'.

com.vmware.vsan.health.test.createvmtest = Virtual machine creation test creates a very simple tiny VM on every host. If that creation succeeds, the VM gets deleted and it can be concluded that a lot of aspects of vSAN are operational. The management stack are all operational on all hosts, vSAN network plumbing is working, creation/deletion and IO to objects on vSAN is working, etc. Doing such an active test can find issues that passive health checks may not be able to detect. By doing so systemically it is also very easy to isolate any particular faulty host and then take steps to remedy.

com.vmware.vsan.health.test.hostdisconnected.short = Checks if VC has an active connection to all hosts in the cluster.
com.vmware.vsan.health.test.hostdisconnected = This check refers to whether VC has an active connection to all hosts in the cluster. If any host is disconnected from VC (or not responding) it could cause operational issues. If VC is not connected to the host, its state is unknown to VC. The host may be up, and may be participating in the vSAN cluster, serving data, and playing a critical role in the storage functions of the cluster. Or the host may be down and unavailable. VC and hence the vSAN Health check cannot fully assess the situation as long the host is disconnected. If the host is participating in the vSAN cluster it will show up in the "Unexpected vSAN cluster member" check as unexpected, as its UUID cannot be determined, so the health check cannot conclusively tell if the host it is seeing in the vSAN cluster is the disconnected one or not. In addition, other health checks, like vSAN connectivity checks or disk health checks will not be able to take the disconnected host into account.

com.vmware.vsan.health.test.hostconnectivity = This check refers to situations where VC lists the host as connected, but API calls from VC to the host are failing. This should be extremely rare, but in case it happens it leads to similar issues as the "Host disconnected from VC" situation.

# Cluster partition check
com.vmware.vsan.health.test.network.clusterPartition.testName = vSAN cluster partition
com.vmware.vsan.health.test.clusterpartition = To ensure proper functionality, all vSAN hosts must be able to communicate over both multicast and unicast. If they cannot, a vSAN cluster will split into multiple "partitions", i.e. sub-groups of hosts that can communicate, but not to other sub-groups. When that happens, vSAN objects might become unavailable until the network misconfiguration is resolved.
com.vmware.vsan.health.test.clusterpartition.short = Checks if the vSAN cluster is partitioned due to a network issue.

# Sever cluster partition check
com.vmware.vsan.health.test.network.serverpartition.testName = Server Cluster Partition
com.vmware.vsan.health.test.serverpartition = Normally all hosts in the client cluster (e.g., client hosts) mounting remote vSAN datastore should be able to communicate with all hosts in the server cluster (e.g., server hosts) exporting the same vSAN datastore. In the case of network partition, however, client hosts may only see a subset of server hosts. It is unlikely but possible that different client hosts see different server hosts. Object availability will be impacted for as long as the partition lasts. This health check is created to monitor cluster state, e.g., which server hosts are available to each client host during network partition. For hosts in one cluster that are not connected to any hosts in the peer cluster, their server partition status remains unknown. Hence those hosts will be shown in the unknown partition group.
com.vmware.vsan.health.test.serverpartition.short = Checks if all hosts in client cluster connected to all hosts in server cluster.

com.vmware.vsan.health.test.multiplevsanvmknic = Multiple vSAN vmknic is disallowed on hosts in remote vSAN client or server cluster. vSAN network best practice calls for a single vSAN vmknic backed by multiple vmnics and leveraging NIC team and load balancing at the virtual or physical network level. Multiple vSAN vmknic support is limited to air-gapped networks where each vSAN vmknic is on a separate subnet with no route in between. Remote vSAN is more likely to run on L3, which does not meet the air-gap requirement.
com.vmware.vsan.health.test.network.multiplevsanvmknic.short = Check if any host in remote vSAN client or server cluster has more than one vSAN vmknic configured.

Adjust multicast IPs using "esxcli vsan network list" and "esxcli vsan network ip set".

To allow for temporary fluctuations, this health check reports warnings based on a conservative threshold of 5ms. If this check fails, please check vmknic, uplink, VLAN, physical switch and associated settings to locate the network issue. NOTE: This check will be skipped if the pair of hosts failed connectivity check.
com.vmware.vsan.health.test.hostlatencycheck.short = Performs a network latency check of vSAN hosts. It requires <1ms RTT.

com.vmware.vsan.health.test.multicastdeepdive = This health check captures multicast packets on all hosts in the cluster for a period of time. It specifically looks for what is known as the "CMMDS Primary Heartbeat". All hosts elected to be a "vSAN/CMMDS Primary" (one per partition) will send such a heartbeat once every second. Such heartbeats are sent over multicast and all hosts in the cluster have to receive them in order for the cluster to function properly. So if a host sends a heartbeat and another host didn't hear it, it indicates a multicast misconfiguration, usually in the physical network.
