We use the longest path algorithm,\n *       which assigns ranks to the lowest position possible. In general this\n *       leads to very wide bottom ranks and unnecessarily long edges.\n *    2.

This by itself greatly improves the assigned\n *       rankings by shorting edges.\n *    3. Iteratively find edges that have negative cut values.
